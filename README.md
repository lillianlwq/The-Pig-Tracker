# The-Pig-Tracker

The TypeScript application that will allow Farmer Hoggett to add, delete, and view all the pigs on his farm.

The main page shows only the name and category of all pigs currently in the system. It contains buttons (or links) that allows the user to delete the pig (if the unthinkable happens) or to display more information about it.

All pigs of a particular category are grouped together and sorted by name.

When the user clicks on the More info button, more information will be revealed.

When the user clicks the Delete button, an alert window will be displayed asking the user to confirm the deletion of the pig.

The main page also has an Add button that allows the user to add new pigs into the system.

When adding a new pig, when a category is chosen, attributes of the pig category will appear dynamically.  For example, if the category black pig is chosen, there could be a drop-down menu for breed that includes Pot-bellied, as well as a text-box for strength.

Used Local Storage to store and retrieve all pigs.
